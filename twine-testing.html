    <h1>Twine Happy-Path Testing for Accessibility</h1>
    <p>
      Twine is a hypertext programming language/editor.
      The most basic form of a Twine story involves no
      logic at all, and is simply constructed from text passages,
      each of which typically contain links (usually highlighted 
      words or phrases) to other passages. Logic can be added with
      macros (essentially simple functions), such as to allow the
      author to change text on-screen based on a timer or user
      interaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Links can be clicked to move one around the story. When the
      link is clicked, a new passage is visited. More complicated
      usages involve injecting the contents of a passage into the
      current passage with the <em>display</em> macro.
    </p>

    <p>
      You also can, in most Twine versions, use the on-page back
      and forward arrows to rewind and fast-forward the state of
      the story. Doing so does not consume time or register as an
      in-world action in any way. In some, but not all formats,
      you can also use the browser back and forward buttons to
      rewind and fast-forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a sample story displaying very simple link mechanics,
      and a basic implementation of a "cycling link," which allows
      one to change text on click,
